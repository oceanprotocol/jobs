# Senior Blockchain Developer

[Ocean Protocol](https://www.oceanprotocol.com) builds tools for people to reclaim control of their data and unleash an open data economy. Ocean tools make it easy to publish & consume data services as ERC20 datatokens, and bridge data to DeFi. Ocean Market is a DEX tuned for data.

Ocean has a vibrant, expanding ecosystem of data suppliers, data consumers, stakers and community developers. To serve it better, we’re hiring! If you are someone that loves to build things and cares deeply about the future of data, we want to hear from you.

## Responsibilities
- You will design, implement, deploy, benchmark, and maintain decentralized software systems
- You will co-plan and co-design the product with your team in an agile, open-source development process

## Skills and Experience 
- We don’t expect applicants to be an expert in everything listed below which is why we’ve separated the requirements into two tiers. The ideal candidate is obsessed with blockchain; has shipped production Solidity contracts; loves to learn; and thrives working in a distributed team environment. 


## Minimum Qualifications
- 5+ years of software experience
- 2+ years blockchain software experience
- You focus on the outcome. You work with the team to set goals, then to achieve the goals. You are a creative “make it happen” problem solver. 
- Proficient in writing & speaking English

## Nice-to-haves
- 6+ months Solidity experience, 2+ years Python, 2+ years JavaScript
- You’re obsessed with blockchain. You follow crypto Twitter, play with dapps, read about Token Engineering, and maybe even yield farm. 
- As a bonus, we'd love to hear about cool stuff you've done with: data/service-oriented Web3 tech (IPFS / Filecoin, TheGraph, Chainlink, Polkadot / Substrate, Cosmos, etc.) or Web2 tech (GraphQL, K8S, Mesosphere, etc.). The nerdier the better:)
- You’re an excellent writer.
- Preferred work hours: 9-5ish on European time zones 
- We don’t expect you to be an expert in all of these. Rather, we’d love to see that you’re *interested* in them, perhaps know one or two as a starting point, and most importantly, that you’ll learn more about them as you grow with us professionally and personally.
