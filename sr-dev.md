Ocean has a vibrant, expanding ecosystem of data suppliers, data consumers, stakers and community developers. To serve it better, we‚Äôre hiring! If you are someone that loves to build things and cares deeply about the future of data, we want to hear from you.

## Responsibilities
* You will design & build Ocean Protocol core software, from the level of blockchain to the level of dapps
* You will co-plan and co-design the product with your team in an agile, open-source development process

## Skills and Experience 
* We don‚Äôt expect applicants to be an expert in everything listed below which is why we‚Äôve separated the requirements into two tiers. The ideal candidate is obsessed with blockchain; has Solidity experience; and thrives in a distributed team environment. 

## Minimum Qualifications
* 5+ years of software experience
* 2+ years Python or Javascript experience 
* 1+ years blockchain software experience

* You‚Äôre an excellent writer.
* Preferred work hours: 9-5ish on European time zones 
* We don‚Äôt expect you to be an expert in all of these. Rather, we‚Äôd love to see that you‚Äôre *interested* in them, perhaps know one or two as a starting point, and most importantly, that you‚Äôll learn more about them as you grow with us professionally and personally.
