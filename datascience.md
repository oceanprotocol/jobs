# üê¨ Data Scientist - Developer

If you love competitive games, Python and AI, then this position may be ideal for you. Read on...

**[Ocean Protocol](https://www.oceanprotocol.com)** was founded to level the playing field for AI and data. Its **[Ocean Predictoor](https://predictoor.ai)** product provides on-chain "prediction feeds" on whether ETH, BTC, etc will rise in the next 5 min or 60 min. **"Predictoors"** submit predictions and stake on them; predictions are aggregated and sold to **traders** as alpha. Since launch 9 months ago, Ocean Predictoor has grown to $100M in monthly volume and 500,000 transactions per day.

We're hiring for the Ocean Predictoor team. If you're a young, hungry data scientist with software chops, or a developer that's been learning AI / data science for fun -- then we want to hear from you!

## Responsibilities
* You will work on algorithms, data infrastructure, and software for financial time-series prediction and trading. (See for yourself: [here's the codebase](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend).)
* All towards a game of "help the community make $ trading", by modeling & trading internally. This is the "competitive game" part of the role.
* You must be self-directing, and committed to learning. We are a small tight-knit team where everyone is pushing themselves. Is this you?

## Qualifications

Minimum qualifications:
* 3+ years of Python experience. We don't care if it's in a company, from your university thesis, or hacking for fun. But you have to seriously love coding. 
* 1+ years of AI/ML/statistics/data science experience. As above: we don't care from what context. But you have to love doing AI. And not be scared of the math. Do you read NeurIPS papers for fun? Have you done tutorials on building LLMs from scratch? Do you get obsessed with pushing the performance of your evolutionary algorithm? If yes to any of these - or similar questions - read on.
* Proficient in speaking & writing English.

Qualifications beyond:
* You may have significantly more experience in software or AI than the minimums described above. Great! Let's talk!

What we are colorblind to:
* Fancy education, fancy past titles, fancy past companies. We don't care about that. Rather: can you build, and are you ready to play the game?

## Details of position
* Work from wherever you want: the position is remote. Bring your own computer.
* We follow an agile, open-source software development practice with continuous integration etc. 
* Preferred work hours: 9-5ish on European time zones. If you need to get up early or stay up late to be available in a core time around 2pm-5pm, that works for us.

## Your Next Step?
If you love competitive games, Python and AI, then we want to hear from you! Please email [jobs@oceanprotocol.com](mailto:jobs@oceanprotocol.com), with:
* code samples. Ideally, your GitHub profile. Show us that you can build software and do AI!
* a paragraph on why you‚Äôd like to join
* your CV. This doesn't need to be fancy. What we really care about is code samples.
